A NOTE ΟΝ PALAEOGRAPHY

ln considering the text of any author, be it ancient or
modern classic, the questions will osten arise in the student's
mind as to what is the cause os a variant, and on what
principles we are to decide on the true reading. When we
find variants even in Shelley and Shakespeare, what should

the original MSS. or the first printed copy, and then examine ’
the reasons lor which a Malone or a Rossetti has altered the
text, and see if these reasons are sufficient. Similarly in
dealing with Sophocles or Tacitus; but as we cannot inspect
the original MSS., we must go back as lar as we can (but,
paradoxical it may be, yet true, mere antiquity does not give
value to a MS.; the most recent may be the most valuable‚
if of pure descent and the representative ol some good
ancestor); and we must compare with our texts the notes of
the scholiasts or ancient commentatore and the quotations
in ancient authors. Both of these, however, must be used
with caution, especially the latter.¹

When the printing of the ancient classics began (chiefly
in the fifteenth century) the scholars used the MSS. most in
favour or most accessible, correcting where they thought fit,
or ‘using some other ancient MS! (a phrase occasionally
employed to give weight to their own conjectures). But
since those days the treasures of more libraries have been
