12 AGRICOLA.

The date ol the historian's death is not known; the last
event alluded to in his books is Trajan’s extension 01 the
Roman frontier to the Red Sea in 115 (Arm. ii. 61). His
descendant the Emperor Tacitus raised a tornb in his honour,
which lasted down nearly to the end 01 the sixteenth century,
when it was destroyed by orders ol Pope Pius V.

01 his private life or personality we know little. A few
facts can be gleaned from Pliny’s letters. He seems to have
been as devoted to field-sports and outdoor-life as to literary
composition and lorensic eloquence, and advised Pliny to
give equal honour to ‘Minerva and Diana’; which advice
Pliny acted upon with some success, for one day as he sat by
the nets during a hunting-drive, with both implements 01 the
chase and writing·materials beside him, three boars fell to
his spear, and we know not how many poems to his pen.

The lriendship between these two rnen evidently arose from Ἴ

similarity 01 taste and character, and was cernented by what
Cicero called the true bond ol friendship, goodness and
uprightness 011110. 11 began with a boy's ardent admiration
on the part 01 Pliny for the older man, who was already
famous at Rome lor his eloquence at ‘the Bar'; it stood the
test 01 many troubled years; in men's last wills they were
generally named together and received the same legacy;
even mutual criticism 01 their literary work brought them
only closer together. “1 have read your book5,'' says Pliny,
“and marked with all possible care what l think needs altera·
tion or excision; sor my way is always to speak my mind and
yours to give glad attention. No one, in fact, takes criticism

. better than those who deserve most praise. lam now looking

(Ep. vii. 20).

01 Tacitus' minor works the Dz'alogrrc on Orators was .
published in the early part 01 Domitian's reign, but the time
is represented as being the sixth year 01 Vespasian's reign3
it exhibits Tacitus’ style as still largely influenced by Cicero.
