122 AGRICOLA.

tyrant, and, sor their policy of non-resistance, against the
senators who had bent to the sturm and given their voices,
under compulsion, against their peers. So Agricola is here
set forth as a moderate and sels-restrained man from youth
to death; in all his dealings, as son and husband, civil
official and legionary legate, in command os a province and
in retirement, he is unobtrusive, unostentatious, and ready
to make concessions; yet, unlike others who held proudly
aloof or devoted themselves to philosophy, and others who
uselessly resisted the monarchy, whoever was the monarch,
he was able to do a great amount os good work in his
generation, and, besides his ordinary routine os business to
set an example for all other governors and commanders by
resorms within his own household, in the administration of his
province, in the encouragement os a barbarous and warlike
people to take up the arts of peace and civilization. But this
biography is so perfect a work of art that this purpose never
obtrudes itsels; it is kept so well in the background, that we
do not feel, as we feel in reading Macaulay’s splendid essay
on Warren Hastings and Carlyle's John Sterling, that the
author holds a special brief for the defence os his hero.

(3) Lastly, in defending Agricola and himself, he was, in fact
is not in intention, defending, amongst other good and able
men, Nerva and Trajan themselves, who had found it neces-
sary to render the same submission to Domitian’s tyranny.
And possibly the account os the bold and forward policy ol
Agricola in Britain, besides being a criticism ol the old
frontier-policy ol Augustus and his successors, which was to
hold but not advance, was meant to pr‘epare the way for the
warlike and ambitious schemes ol Trajan ; at least we may
say on this point that the story of the strong but just
administration and os the warlike energy of the British
governor was an excellent prelude to the new era that was
then opening sor the Roman Empire, under “bonus Nerva,
Traianus strenuus (Hadrian omitted), Pius innocens, Marcus
plenus officii”, as Symmachus calls them,-the new era ol
justice, activity, and firm govemment at home and abroad.
