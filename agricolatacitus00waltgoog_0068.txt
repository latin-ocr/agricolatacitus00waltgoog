’ 2. Orsini's conjectures (1595), which are· valuable as being
based sometimes on the authority of an old MS.

Pomponius’ text, which often restored the real MS. reading.

ἵ Ch. i. 4. quarn . . . inauraturae So Wex punctuates, and Good-
hart (C. R, ii. p. 227) follows him, making a contrast between
narratura (which 'necessarily implies laudatiori) and incusaturus.
Gantrelle punctuates quam . . . incusaturus. Tam . . . tempora
exegimus (and writes suit for fuisse).

'Ch iv. 4. aerias ultraque. Bihrens’ for MSS. aerim ultra*
{lireittgpemfwritten q) would easily drop out before quamquam

ac senatori, Gudeman athetizes.

The words seem to have their place: ‘a senator' in such context
can mean ‘a future senator' without any forcing; and a politician
needs practical knowledge of life more than anyone else.

Ch. v. 3. excitatior, Buchner. The MSS. exercitatior, ‘more
iffiiffiieis defended by Hor. Epod. 9. 31, but is considered nearly

Puteolanus reads intercepti.

Ch. vi. 4. rector. MSS. have certior ; Rhenanus’ tenor has been

which it may have arisen by metathesis or a change of order of letters;
(and cf. exemplum et rectores iu xxviii).

MSS. mediarananis. Lipsius, moderationis (with duxit); Gude-
man, aredio moderationis, δια, the error perhaps due to enode being

Ch. ix. 3. nullam . . . personam: so MSS, which Gudeman
keeps, understanding egit, the usual wordfor acting a part: egit is¹

which is really included in abstinentiam and perhaps we should put
tristitiam. . . exererat after deminuit, instead of condemning the
