'illerum spatia, ‘the duration of daylight is longer than in our
(part of the) world' (At Rome longest day has 15 hours, at London
16y, Aberdeen 18.) Cf. Caesar, B. G. v. 13. Jordhnes quotes
Tacitus thus: tractem quoqne clariorem in 1111111111 eius parte mini-
mamque Cornelius ettam uernalium scriptor enarrat, and rn Get. 3
says that to the Scandinavians the sun per terrae marginem dicit tur
circuire, i.e. passes across the horizon. Juvenal’s minima contentos

§4 Scilicet, &c ‘The reason being that the flat edge of the
earth, with its low shadow, does not throw the darkness up high,
and so night fails to reach the sky and stars.’ Tacitus seems still
to have supposed the earth to be a disc, and night was a shadow
from the sun being below the earth; so he was in scientific know-
ledge below the learned Romans of his own and earlier times, and
the Greeks of the fourth century Β. c.
