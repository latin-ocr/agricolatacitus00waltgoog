Cornelius Tacitus belonged toan equestrian family, and
was born between 50 and 55 Ad). Interamna (Terni) claims
to be his birthplace, merely, it seemS, because the emperor
Tacitus (ml). 275), who was said to be descended from the
historian, came from there. He was trained for ‘the Bar ',
being probably a pupil ol the grammarian Quintilian, the
greatest of‘all Roman teachers and professors os education‚
and enjoyed in his youth the society os the most learned men
ol his days. Later, he was, as we have seen, with the younger
Pliny, the man best known to the Roman literary world. lt
has been supposed that he went in 74 to Aquitania with
Agricola, whose daughter he married in 78. At any rate,
about this time he began his political career, for he says that
Vespasian gave him his first step, and Titus his second.
Under Domitian he became a praetor in 88, and as acommis-
sioner of religious ceremonies (quindecimvir saculi saczkndis)
he presided with his colleagues at the celebration ol the
Secular Games, which were held once in a century, and for
the last celebration os which, under Augustus, Horace had

ln Aquitania he perhaps served his military apprenticeship,

political lile should begin by taking an honorary military
tribunate, which was a staff-appointment with the nominal
rank os tribune. By ‘the first and second steps’ Tacitus

of soldiering, financial administration, and city-duties. The
praetorship that came next would give him an insight into
the workings ol the law-courts and some knowledge os law.
With this training a man would be well equipped sor the
greater offices in the city itsell and lor the higher duties
os provincial government. ln the course ot his career a
priesthood, flamenship, or some duties in connexion with
the state-religion would be generally added; forat Rome
‘church’ and ‘state' were inseparably united, the emperor
