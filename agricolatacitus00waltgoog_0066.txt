ransacked, the sands os Egypt have given up some of its
bordes, authors and parts os authors hitherto unknown have
been rediscovered (eg. Herondas, The Polity os Athens

reputed to be Aristotle's, Cicero's Republica, and the recent .

discovery at Oxlord os a fragment os Juvenal); ancient sites
have been examined, thousands of inscriptions and coins have
been brought to light, giving fresh data for settling points
os orthography and antiquity‚ the original text ol decrees,
δια, and, in one case, of a whole poem (Horace's “Carmen
Saeculare ”), recovered.

On all this extra material palaeographists have been at work,
- have collated the different MSS, and used improved know-
ledge (r) to try to find the origin and relationship of the
various MSS.; and have grouped them, as families are in a
genealogical tree‚ under common archetypes, and those that
show the purest descent are the best. All this is done by the

. closest examination oi the words, spelling, dre, the errors,

variants, lacunae, and so forth all helping to show relationship.
’ (2) Secondly, they have studied the handwriting‚ methods
ol abbreviation, and writing material os different ages and
countries; chemistry has been called in to help sor palimp
sests, and has removed the stewards' accounts or monks' lives
of saints written over the erased classic, and thus the original
has been restored. So the proximate date of a MS. can be
told, and also oi its marginal notes and corrections.

(3) Thirdly, they have examined minutely blunders and
' causes of blunders, and noted what words are specially liable
to perversion. Amongst the causes are imperfect hearing¹

(in dictation); alteration due to misunderstanding and desire
, to make sense,² on the part both of the learned and ignorant;
miscopying due to the eye or mind travelling too sast³ (just
now l wrote ‘wham' sor ‘what am'); or due to obscurity⁴
and ambiguities os abbreviation⁶ in the previous writing, or .
to metathesis of letters,⁰ dittography or repetition ol partos a
