HINTS ΟΝ TRANSLATION

1. Make mentally a literal translation, word for word, as
each word comes in tlte Latin, taking care not to slur the
parsing os a single word in all its posszlzlities. (ln verse the
scanning will help the parsing.)

· 2. As the complete sentence is evolved, settle any doubtful
points os parsing‚ mark the beginning and end os the sepa-
rate clauses, and shape them a little more into English order.

(By attending to these two points you will not miss any words, and
you will realize more thoroughly the language in which a Roman clothed
his thoughts. and also the Latin order ol sentences. Though atfirst
the process may be slow. it is surer, and leads to greater readiness in
translating. Take the words, then, as they corne. sor so they came to
a Latin eye or ear, checking continually what has gone before by what
follows, until the sentence is finished.)
