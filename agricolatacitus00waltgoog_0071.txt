3. adaquandum, &c Halm’s reading for MSS. ad aquam atque
ut illa raptis secum plerisque, (utilia being Selling's); Ritter, raptis
secum quae ebria, egressi, etcum. Emendations are numerous.

Ch. xxx. 4 atqueemne ignotum, &a .. ‚sect Brueysand others for
reading of MSS., which have this clause after patet. Draeger keeps
order of MSS., but changes atque t0 atqui (=‘ but you say ), which
is necessary then, the imaginary objection being met by sed nulla, &a

6. terrae, iares et. Halm’s for terram et; others, terrae, et.
Ch. xxxi. 5.
’ MSS., inpoenitentium laturi.

Wex, in paenitentiam arena laturi.

Koch, Urlichs, in paenitentiam bellaturi (regret, i.e. failure).

Peter, bellaturis (agr. with Romanis), ‘who will have to fight
against liberty, not rebellion '.

Similar is A(r÷dretse)n’s reading, libertatem nen paenitentiam alla·
ure. ex.

Peter’s alternative, in libertate nen in paenitentia bellaturi.

Welfflin, in patientiam bellaturi (taken by Halm), which seems
to get an antithesis without much point, ‘who will light to
secure liberty, not (a return to) subjection'‚ as the Iceni
had done; cl. veteri patientiae restituit in xvi.

(Andresen's seems to me the best, and gives a natural form of
expression with a reference to the Iceni's rebellion3 but Furneaux
thinks some addition is wanted. There is an apparently superfluous
in in xxiv. 2, which may be for iarm perhaps the in here is also sor
rane.)

Ch. xxxii. 3. runeera, circum trepides, is the MSS. reading in which
Anquetil reads lacerum lor circum. Heumann omits circum, as being
borrowed from next line. Ι have united circum with spectantes, as
Halm seems to have meant.

Ch. xxxiii. 2. vestra inserted by Nipperdey. It is not needed:
‘by valour’ would necessarily mean ‘by your valour' (with vicistis).
Perhaps, as Gudeman (C. R, May, ’99) shows, we should transpose
vestra and nestra on the analogy os Xen. Hell. i. 1. 27.

4. aristeus, MSS. acies, Rhenanus.

Ch. xxxiv. 3. extremus, dec.
MSS. ‚ et extremo metu corpora defixere aciem.
Ritter, „ ,‚ torpor ‚, „
Wex, extreme metu corpora defixere.
Schoemann, et extremus metus torpere defixere aciem. (Text.)
Gudeman, et extremus metas corpora defixere.

Bezzenberger, novissimi haesere et extreme metu ac torpere
defixere acerra.

Schoemann’s (ct. Livy ix. 2. roland Gudeman’s seem best,
