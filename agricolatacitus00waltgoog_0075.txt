CHAPTER ΙΙ.

ἓ 1. Iagtmus, ‘we find recorded’ (in the acta senatus).

Aruleno Rustico was tribune of the plebs in A. Ι). 66, the year ol
the condemnation of his friend and master, Paetus Thrasea, on whom
afterwards he wrote a panegyrie; for this he was put to death by
Domitian in 93 or 94. He was a friend of Pliny, and is mentioned
again in xlv, and often in Pliny's letters (ag. iii. 11. 3). Suetonius
(Dom. 10) implies that he also expressed approval of Helvidius'
opposition to Vespasian. (Notice the dative of the agent.)

Paetus Thrasea3 a high-minded senator who followed the Stoic
philosophy, and by his fearless opposition to Nero, won that tyrant’s
enmity. The obsequious senate at Nero’s orders condemned him
to death in 66. In the Annals, xvi. 21-35, Tacitus gives a striking
account of his end.
