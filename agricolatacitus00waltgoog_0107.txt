§a incertum, ‘vague ', ‘perplexing’ (as the natives did not know
where it would attach).

expedito, ‘in light marching order ².

longa pace, instrumental abl. ; ‘tested by their peaceful attitude
of many years '.

Graupium, site not known. Forfar, Brechin, Ardoch, have been
proposed. The latter is most savoured, as remains of a Roman
camp exist there. Everyone, like Scott's Antiquary, has his own
favourite spot in conspectu classis, and so forth, (and perhaps his
Α D L L, or other imaginary relic os antiquity) ; but we can never
know, and in fact we may say with Lovel: ‘Pitch Agricola's camp
at the Kaim ol —3 what do you oell it?' (Not Graupium, as
was the old reading, from which the modern name is derived.)

§a nihil, acc. with fracti ; ‘to no extent ’‚ i.e. ‘by no means’.

viridisque senectus, ‘ripe and vigorous '.

decora, ‘distinctions’ won in battle.
plures, ‘numerous ’, as in ch. xxv. 3.

CHAPTER XXX.

Calgacus' speech in xxm-xxxii, and Agricola's in xxxiii-xxxiv„
are contrasted after the manner of the Greek historiens, especially
Thucydides, not merely to give dramatic effect but also to set forth
the situation in the most artistic form. Instead of a learned disser-
tation from the authors on the position of affairs, we have the same
put into the form of a speech, artistically fitted on to the narrative.
The Greek and Roman schools of oratory and declamation had much
influence in giving history this sorm, and the speeches themselves
their tone of anticipating or meeting the opponent’s arguments.
