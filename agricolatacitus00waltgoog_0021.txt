of the speeches that he puts into the mouths of his public
men. We can trust his facts, we must not always trust his
judgement3 political antipathies and his lorensic training
have osten biassed his conclusions or led him to assume the
position ol a counsel for defence or prosecution. Moreover,
his biographical and annalistic methodos treatment militates
against a scientific arrangement of historical facts, and his
range of view rarely travels beyond Rome itself; from a
historian of the Empire we should expect to be told much of
the organization, administration, financial system, provincial
life, art, religion, and other details ol the great Roman
world; but, like Thucydides, Tacitus tells us very little, as
though such matters did not concern historians. Yet in the
Agricola, he has shown in his sketch of his father-in-law’s ’
reforms and efforts at civilizing‘ that he could have discussed
these matters thoroughly and sympathetically.

ln his politics he aflects, especially in the Annals, a
republicanism which he was probably sar from really seeling;
much of this tone was due to the-customary exaggeration of
the schools os declamation, to mere sentimental talk, toa
sashionable hero-worship of Brutus, Cassius and Cato (cf.
, Pliny, Ep. i. 17), and to the constant discontent of the
aristocracy that found expression in bitter epigrams and
libels (of which the pages of Suetonius are full). Though he
impeaches with all the energy of a public prosecutor the
imperial administration when in the hands of a Tiberius, a
Nem, or a Domitian, yet his sympathies seem really with
asort of constitutional monarchy‚ a true union ol ‘libertas'
and ‘principatus' (Agricola, ch. iii.) such as he says Rome
enjoyed under Nerva and had expected from the ‘civilis
animus’ os Germanicus, the father of Caligula. As a prac-
tical politician he accepted the inevitable, even under

Domitian, and throughout his' public career acted as a loyal
‘servant of the crown' for the good of his country3 at the
same time his personal and literary influence must un-
doubtedly have largely affected the administration of the
Empire when govemed (after Domitian's death) by that
noble line of adoptive sons, from Nerva to Marcus Aurelius,
