cnrrrcar. Annnwnrx. 65

Ch. xix. 1. iniuriae. Puteolanus’ emendation for incuriae, which
would mean ‘careless neglect ’. Cf. ch. xx. (This reverses the rule
of MSS. changes3 for ἐπαινέαι is more likely to have been altered
to ipiurrae by copyists than the other way, being the less common
wor .)

2. ffinrum. A has parmam, and §udeman defends it (C.¹R.‚
Oct. 97), and compares srmrlar attractron rnch.xx1v. 1, nave praeta.
Ann. xiv. 10, and xii. 19. 6, &a

4 aequalitate. Puteolanus for inequalitate (which is not an un·
suitable word for fair taxation, ‘fair unevenness’, ‘graduation of
burdens '). Muretus gives aequitate.

ae ludere, MSS. reading. ch, ae luere3 Heraeus, ac liceri 3
Hutter, ac recludere ; Urlichs, auctiore.

Ch. xx. 2. resultus. Now read for multum, Band corr. A.

· 2. invitamenta. Acidalius and Lipsius for MSS. irritamenta.
Perhaps incitamenta, as in xxxii.

3. ut. . . pars. Illacesa'ta transiit, Susius3 for MSS. ut. ..pars
illacesita transierit. (Transierat would have been a correction for
transiet, taken with ut in the sense of ‘so that'3 whereas Susius’
reading takes ut=quanta, ‘as no newly-conquered portion had ever
before been ’.l Weissenborn inserted the necessary pariter alter pars.

Ch. xxii. 3. crebrae eruptiones, put by Halm aster laicata by MSS.
after desertum.

Ch. xxiv. 2. differtin melius. aditus MSS.

dffrunt, Rhenanus.

dffrt }melius adittts{Wex',
dtfflramt Orellr.
differt Ritter.
deserant Halm.

of these the MSS. reading is strange and unlikely, as seems gener·
ally agreedz interiora pateam is unwarranted, and has met with little
favour. Could we not translate ‘have become better known (than
formerlyl'? and perhaps change in to ram (cf. xxxi. 5).

Ch. xxv. 1. hostibus, Becker, followed by Halm.
hastilis, MSS.; tle. Roman.
testificanda, Rhenanus; ie. a British army.

Ch. xxvii. 3. se . . . vz'ctas, Brotier’s addition, from Hist. ii. 44.
elusos, Kritz.
superati, Ritter.

}interiara parum, melius aditus{

ch. xxviii. 2. retro remigante, Gudeman (C. R„ Oct. ²97), for
MSS. remigante (= ‘ directing the rowing’), retra falling out because
of re following. Other proposals are remeante, regente, martgerante
(Wex)‚ refugiente, renatante, &c.; renaazgante‚ Miitzell and Halm.
