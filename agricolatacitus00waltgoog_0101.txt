CHAPTER XXI.

The civilization ol Britain here described must have been really
going on since Julius Caesar’s days: Agricola by systematizing it
gave itan impulse. Strabo (using perhaps Caesar's account) says:
‘The thickets are their towns3 lor having lenced with selled trees
a wide enclosure, there they both dwell themselves in huts and stall
their cattle'. Mela mentions the use ol woad, as does Caesar;
ancl Claudiam, even in the time ol Honorius, speaks os tattooing‚
Britannia . . . ferro pe‘cta genas (Stil. 2. 247), which either is mere
poetieal commonplace or refers to the northern tribes. Mela also
mentions the constant intertribal wars lrom lust ol rule or territory.

Tacitus' manner. clxxxi. 1.
