CHAPTER X.

§L scriptoribus. Tacitus mentions Caesar, Livy, Fabius Rus-
ticus (historian of Nero’s and perhaps of Clauclius’ reign).

Other Roman authors were Pomponius Mela (n. D. 45) and Pliny
Ι, (oh. 79 A.u.); and Greek, Pytheas (uc. 325), Timaeus (264 Β.ε.),
Strabo (uc. 24), and Diodorus (8 B.c.); (and later, Dio Cassius (180
an), Jordanes (552 nia), who compiled from Eusebius, Cassio-
dorius, and others).

ability into comparison with theirs'.

comperta, with quae.

For the sky was marked out (cf. Virg. Ecl. 3. 41), and divided
into regions and zones, as we now divide the earth.

Hispaniae. The ancients were strangely confused about the
direction of Spain. Strabo places the Pyrenees north and south.
The Latin writers from Caesar(B. G. v. 13) to Jordanes (Get. ii.) all
elevated Spain and depressed Britain and lreland.

Servius (on Virg. Ecl. i. 67) recognizes that Britain was once
joined to the mainland

conire, adjectiva13 cf. statim in ix. 6.

§³. scutulae vel bipenni. The scutula seems in shape to have
been rhomhoidal or reetangular; the bz'pss11m's (without the handle) was
roughly lik'e two triangles. Caesar and Mela call Britain triquetra,
triangular, and perhaps bipennis isa single axe-head here, as would
seem to be implied by the words immediately following.

Libius, circumvectus est; (cf. ch. xxxviii. 5 for this voyage).

oreadas. Cf. Juv. ii. 163, Orcadas vitoda captas. The Orkneys

are mentioned by Mela (3. 6. 54) and Pliny (iv. 6. 5ο. 405).Ι
