120 AGRICOLA.

loyal subject. But Tacitus, wishing to represent Agricola
as one of Domitian's victims, turns his attentions to the
dying man into evidence of his guilt, and his anxiety for
news into an eagerness to hear of death. An amir of
Asghanistan might send the court-physician to give a dan-
gerous and troublesome chieftain such professional atten-
tions and such instances of the royal interest in his sickness
that there is no sear of the man's di'sloyalty ever after. But
in the case before uS, the emperor had no fear of the sub·
ject, and had in fact anticipated any danger from him by
keeping him at Rome unemployed ; so that the only motive
,for murder would be the natural malignity of an evil fora
good man, the feeling that his own vice and cruelty is
silently rebuked by the others virtue and gentleness. A

Trajan visits a dying friend and all the world extols his
graciousness; a Domitian, perhaps from a feeling of remorse
for undue neglect, ‘sends to enquire’, and is branded through
all time with the infamy ofa cold·blooded murder.
