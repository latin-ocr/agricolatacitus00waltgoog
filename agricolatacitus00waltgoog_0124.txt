As to Domitian's treatment of Agricola, it was natural
and even necessary for his own protection; his father

interest, of every Roman general to guard the frontiers
entrusted to his care, without aspiring to conquests which
might have proved no less fatal to himself than to the
vanquished barbarian '’. Germanicus also and Suetonius
