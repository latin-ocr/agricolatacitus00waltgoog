preceding word;¹ and further, incorporation of marginal notes
into the text,2 or acceptance of other authors’ quotations as
though necessarily exact.

(4) Misplacements are due to putting marginal corrections
of omissions into the wrong place 3³ or when on a large scale,

to pages getting out of order, as Prof. Cook Wilson shows
happened to Aristotle's thz'cs V, and ΜΓ. Housman thinks
happened· to Propertius

(5) Lastly, we must remember the possibility of the author’s
own corrections and revision (ag. Euripides' szopolylm,
Tennyson's Dream ofFair Women). ’

So in considering emendations we must see if we can thereby
reconcile or explain diversities between MSS. of the same
family, and further between that family and different families;
we must account for the error on one of the recognized prin-
ciples above referred t0; and in general we should choose the'
rarer and more difficult word or phrase for the commoner and
easier (for there would be glosses in the margin); and be very
chary of accepting arguments merely from an author’s style.

THE TEXT OF THE AGRICOLA

There are only three MSS. of the Agricola extant3 two in the
Vatican, and of the fifteenth century perhaps, and both probably
from a common archetype: ·

(1) Called Γ by Furneaux, A by Halm. This is a copy of a
MS. by ‘Pomponius Laetus, with his corrections and his
conjectures. (Readings from other sources Laetus marks
al for alii.) This is our chief authority for the text.

(2) Called Δ by Furneaux, B hy Halm. This is not so good,
but has in places the better readings and also better spell-
ing throughout, as the old spelling has not been moclernized.

(3) The third is at Toledo (the MS. contains the Germania,
the Agricola, some letters of Pliny, δια, and is dated 1471).
The bishop allows no collation to be made. (Furneaux in
Classical Review, June 1899.)

Other authorities are:

1. Puteolanus' first printed text, about 1480, which is probably
' fr'om the original MSS. off* (A), but much inferior to that.¹

¹ A.'s ntem in xxxvii. 4ff). ² xliv. 2, metus (l).
³ix. 3 and 4(?); xliv. 3(?).
