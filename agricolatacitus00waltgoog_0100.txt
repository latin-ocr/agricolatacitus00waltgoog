Sicily, the Britons' com in some cases was rejected or not procur·
able, and they were compelled to purchase at Roman fancy-prices,
and so pay their -dues in kind (cf. Cic. Verr. l.c. 74, 173); further,
(2) the governor appointed the place where the com should be
delivered3 and the avaricious so arranged these places that the
people were glad to pay an increased price to save the trouble and

chusia Why ‘ shut'? If the above explanation is correct, clausis
must mean that they were not allowed to see and value the corn;
and they were further humiliated by being kept waiting like peti·
tioners at the doors of grandees.

luttere pretio, ‘pay a fancy-price', or ‘play at buying’. See
Critical Appendix.

§ia Divertia, δια, ‘circuitous routes and distant districts ’.

proximis. Halm’s pro before proximis is really unnecessary3 for
prexirm's· hibernis could be abl. abs, ‘though the quarters were near ’.

deferrent, ‘might have to carry '.

ln promptu, ‘close at hand (and therefore inexpensive)'; or
‘a service easy to all’ (Fumeaux).

CHAPTER XX.

§n famam paei Cf. Milton on Cromwell, ‘Peace hath her
victories no less renowned than war '.

intolerantia, ‘overbearing conduct '.
§2— contracto, ir. from their various winter-quarters.

multus ln agmine, ‘making his presence felt everywhere on the
march'. Cf. Sallust, Jug. 96. 3, in operibus, in agmine atque ad
vigilias multus adesse, and Jug. 84. 1, nrulius instare, and ch.
xxxvii, frequens ubique.

modestiam, ‘obedience ' (a common sense of modestia in Tacitus).
Cf. xxx. 5. For nzodesriam=modesr0s‚ cf. paenitentiae in xvi. 3.

There is here a very simple instance of the figure chiasmus, cross-
construction or cross-antithesis; thus:

laudare >< modestiam

disiectos coercere3

the words balance inversely to their order. In xxxvi. 1 there is
an instance without antithesis.

praetemptare, ‘survey '.

ninii . . . quletum pati, quo minus, ‘did not give the enemya
montenis rest without, &c.’.
