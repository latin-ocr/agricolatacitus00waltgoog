and finished under Trajan (cf. ch. 3. and 44), shows him
under the influence of Sallust chiefly, both in arrange-
ment and language, there are reminiscences also of Cicero,
Livy, and Virgil, but of the last not so many as in the later
works. The style, τοο, is looser, the language more rhetorical
and redundant, less terse and precise than in the Α nnals and .
