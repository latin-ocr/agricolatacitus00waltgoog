76 'manicone

quibus, ‘in which an ill-construction was put on eminent men’,
or, as we should say, ‘on their deeds': eg. Nero from jealous
motives recalled Corbulo from Armenia (Hist. ii. 76) 3 and 'liberius
recalled Germanicus from Germany.

CHAPTER VI.

§L splendidis natalibus, ‘an equestrian family ’. Splendidus
is specially applied to the knights. Natales, as subst, belongs to

Silver Latin. Ἰ ¹
ad maiora nitenti, ‘in his rise to greatness ’.

in vicem ee anteponendo, ‘by deference to each other's opinion ’,
or by ‘mutual seli-denial '. (bie is governed by arete. Clearness is
sacrificed to conciseness.)

' niel quod, ‘except that ', ‘and yet': correcting or qualifying a
previous statement, or, as here, something implied in a statement
(cf. ch. xvi. 6 and Ann. i. 33. 5 and xiv. 14. 6); ie. good as she was,
we must remember that a good woman is unduly praised just as
a bad one is unduly censured (or deserves more p'raise and censure
thanaman).

§2 quaesturae. The earliest age for the office was 25: (Tac.
Ann. xi. 22). The full rotation of office was thus: mil. tribunate,
quaestorship, aedileship or plebeian tribunate, praetorship, (some
minor city-office), (command ol legion), gov. of minor province,
consulship, (higher city-office), gov. of greater province, gov. of Asia
or Africa. Priesthood added causa horteris: Agricola’s came aster
his consulship.

Asiam, ie. the Roman province in Western Asia Minor.

pro consule = procurandam: and below = proconsul. (It is found
as one word as early as Livy, but the strict form is' as in the text.)

suetus Titianus, proconsul of Asia in 63, 64. He was the
elder brother of Otho, emperor for a short time in 69. The name
‘Titianus' he received from his mat'emal grandfather, for the
Romans had begun to multiply family names even without adoption,
and sometimes carried their whole pedigree in their names. In the
time of Antoninus Pius we hear of one noble with 22 (or was it 32?)
names3 Antoninus had about six himself.

quorum neuma, ‘by neither fact ', tle. neither province nor pro-
consul, as explained in the next words.

quemquam, with subj. Even in Livy the distinction of mood
yysiglp pvzcipprpy'pipnd quamquam is not kept3 quamvis is even frequently

perata peccantibus, ‘lying at the mercy of offenders ’, ae. the
submissive victim of extortionate governors.
